# Thai Tax Rules 2024 (Simple Guide)

This document explains the Thai Personal Income Tax rules for the tax year **2567 (2024)** in simple terms.

## 0. Key Concepts (Read This First)
Understanding these two terms will help you plan your tax immediately.

### **Total Income (The Starting Amount)**
Think of this as your "Budget for Tax Planning". This is the total money you earned all year.
*   **"This is the starting amount that you have to allocate across your RMFs, SSFs, and Insurance."**
*   The more you allocate this starting amount into the "deduction" buckets below, the less tax you will pay.

### **Net Taxable Income (เงินได้สุทธิ)**
*   **Definition:** This is your "Final Score" after all deductions.
*   **Meaning:** This number determines your **Tax Bill (ภาษีที่ต้องจ่าย)**.
    *   *Formula:* `Total Income` - `Expenses` - `Deductions` = `Net Taxable Income`.
    *   **Practical Note:** Think of your income as the starting amount that you have to allocate across your RMFs, SSFs, and Insurance to bring this number down.
    *   If this number is **0 - 150,000**, you pay **0 Baht**.
    *   If this number is higher, you enter the "Tax Brackets" (see Section 8).

## 1. Basic Income Deduction

## 2. Family & Personal Allowances
These are "free" deductions you get based on your personal situation.

Giving back helps you too. Deducted **after** all other deductions above.

## 7. How Tax is Calculated (Tax Brackets)
After deducting everything above from your **Total Income**, the remaining amount is your **Net Taxable Income**. It is taxed in steps (Progressive Rate):

| If your Net Taxable Income is... | You pay... |
| :--- | :--- |
| **0 - 150,000** | **0% (Free)** |
| 150,001 - 300,000 | 5% |
| 300,001 - 500,000 | 10% |
| 500,001 - 750,000 | 15% |
| 750,001 - 1,000,000 | 20% |
| 1,000,001 - 2,000,000 | 25% |
| 2,000,001 - 5,000,000 | 30% |
